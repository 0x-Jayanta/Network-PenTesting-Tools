It allows you to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time or from a previously captured file. `tcpdump` is a valuable tool for network troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis. Here are some common uses and commands for `tcpdump`

![TCP Dump](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x-Jayanta/HPTI-SEP23-109/main/images/tcpdump.png)

1. **Capture Packets in Real-Time:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface>
   ```
   Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you want to capture packets from (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

2. **Capture Packets to a File:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -w <output_file>
   ```
   This command captures packets from the specified interface and saves them to the specified output file for later analysis.

3. **Display Captured Packets Verbosely:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -v
   ```
   This option provides more detailed information about captured packets, including the packet header.

4. **Filter Packets by Protocol:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> icmp
   ```
   Replace `icmp` with the protocol you want to filter. You can use protocols like `tcp`, `udp`, `http`, or `ssh`.

5. **Capture Packets with a Specific Port:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> port <port_number>
   ```
   Replace `<port_number>` with the specific port you want to capture packets for.

6. **Capture Packets with Source/Destination IP:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> src <source_ip>
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> dst <destination_ip>
   ```
   Use these commands to filter packets based on their source or destination IP address.

7. **Display Hexadecimal and ASCII Dump:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -XX
   ```
   This option displays both the hexadecimal and ASCII representation of packet data.

8. **Read Packets from a Capture File:**
   ```
   tcpdump -r <input_file>
   ```
   This allows you to analyze previously captured packets from a file.

9. **Limit the Number of Packets to Capture:**
   ```
   sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -c <count>
   ```
   Replace `<count>` with the number of packets you want to capture before `tcpdump` exits.

10. **Save Captured Packets as a PCAP File:**
    ```
    sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -w <output_file>.pcap
    ```
    This command saves the captured packets in the PCAP (Packet Capture) format, which is widely supported by network analysis tools.

## Usage

### Basic Usage:

To perform DNS spoofing on a network, use the following command:

```bash
dnsspoof -i <interface> -f <hosts_file>
```
`interface`: Specify the network interface to listen for DNS requests and send spoofed responses.

`hosts_file:` Provide a file with DNS spoofing rules to define target domains and their corresponding IP addresses.

### Example Hosts File:
Here's an example of a hosts_file you could create:
```bash
www.google.com 192.168.1.100
mail.google.com 192.168.1.101
```
This rule means that when a device on the network queries for **www.google.com,** dnsspoof will respond with the IP address 192.168.1.100.

### Running dnsspoof:
1) Identify the network interface you want to listen on. You can use the ifconfig or ip addr command to list available network interfaces.

2) Create a hosts_file containing the DNS spoofing rules.

3) Run dnsspoof with the chosen network interface and the path to the hosts_file:
```shell
